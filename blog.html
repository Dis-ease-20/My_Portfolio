				 Create by Tim Berners-Lee in Dec 1999 HTML which stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language is the standardized way to display text and pictures on the World Wide Web.
				 HTML is one of the of the most important scripting language used to construct, develop and create websites. HTML uses tags which look like this â€œ<> </>â€ to communicate with the developer and the web browser.  
				 When going into web development there are 3 important languages you will in counter which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript which will be covered in the next article.

				Why HTML 5??
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Looking at the history of the internet, there has been a huge boom in the internet space in the 1900s through to the 200s where we saw applications such as YouTube,
				Facebook and Twitter being born, but the issue with the web browsers then is that it could not handle features such as video and audio and needed external plugs such as Flash, 
				but the problem would be these plug-ins would be big in memory and would kill mobile battery life. In 2014 HTML developers released HTML 5 which is now able to handle audio, 
				video and vector graphics which means you can enlarge and decrease images without loosing the quality. For the most part the internet is filled with many different websites 
				and html seems to be a technology that is going to be around for many more years as this is the core foundation to creating websites.

         Created by Hakon Wium Lie in Oct 1994, CSS stands for Cascade Style Sheet. CSS is one of the most important elements and languages used to create websites.
         Just as much as HTML, CSS plays the role of decorating and styling the website to make it look more professional and appealing to the user. In this field you will 
         see job titles such as UI designers which purely focuses on the look and feel of the website. CSS uses its own syntax such as curly braces and semi-colons rather than tags like HTML.
         CSS however does require more practice and understanding because it has a lot of properties to change things like resizing images, increasing text size and color, to positioning things in the 
         right place and not forgetting having a good eye for design, color scheme and layouts.

         Why CSS 3?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       The evolution of CSS is much like HTML, remember that these two technologies will always go hand in in hand in web development. As HMTL improves so does CSS, 
        the third version of CSS include very interesting properties that have animations, rotations, pop ups without using JavaScript. On of the popular proprieties
        in CSS is Flex Box and CSS Grids.

				 <h1 style="color:white; text-align:center; font-size: 50px;text-decoration: underline;"> What is Web Development?</h1>
				 <h4 style="color:white; text-align:center; font-size: 30px;"> Jan 2021</h4>
				 <p style="color:white; text-align:center; font-size: 20px;">
				 
				 Web development is basically the application, discipline and creation of building modern websites. There a re a few fundamental principles when going into web development, here are they:
<br/>
<br/>
&middot	Client side (Front end):
<br/>
<br/>
This means everything you see on the web browser, this deals with the look and feel, the functionality and special features the website has. 
<br/>
<br/>
&middot	Server side (Back end):
<br/>
<br/>
This means everything that happens in the background/ behind the scenes, all the functionally that you may not see such as requesting a certain website and connecting to databases.
<br/>
<br/>
&middot	Database:
<br/>
<br/>
A database is a tool that is used to store user information such as login details, authentication and security. 
<br/>
<br/>

Now that we understand the principles, there are 3 types of web developers, which are:
<br/>
<br/>
1.	Frontend web developer 
<br/>

2.	Backend web developer
<br/>

3.	Full-stack web developer
<br/>
<br/>

Explaining the differences shall be discussed in a much later article. One of the key attributes to become a web developer is to have a strong eye of design principles such as
 layout and color schemes as well as has having strong understanding of code logic. The main languages for web developers for beginners would be HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript, 
 as you progress you can pick up frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, PHP, Python and many more.

<p style="color:white; text-align:center; font-size: 20px;">
Do you need a degree to become a web developer?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having a degree/diploma is recommended and will place you at a very good advantage when applying for jobs, this just gives companies more confidence that you understand some 
programming principles and concepts such as Object Orientated Programming (OOP) but with the rapid increate in technology and more companies going online, becoming a web developer 
is one of the easiest ways to get into the tech space and you do not require a degree or diploma, one of the biggest perks of becoming a web developer in 2021 is the international
 opportunities, remote work and really good paying salaries.
